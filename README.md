corona
======

A jupyter notebook to display data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

This is a hobby project and I have no expertise in the field. You can getter better information from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus (and the references therein).

Setup
-----

This depends on your python setup, I use:

```
# create and activate virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
jupyter lab
```
